\section{Project Information and Instructions}
All information on projects should be stored on GitHub where everyone can read the files - user level access can be granted to members so they can push files to the repository.\newline
Website URL – \url{www.students.aberrobotics.club}
Instructions should include design specification (the need and aim), hardware layout, software needed to get going, other details can follow.\newline
All instructions to be as a \textbf{.md} or exported as a \textbf{.pdf} and uploaded to GitHub and the website \url{www.students.aberrobotics.club}.
