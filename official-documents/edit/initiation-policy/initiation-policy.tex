\abstract{Aberystwyth University Students’ Union believes the practice of initiations is a dangerous and degrading exercise that jeopardises the safety of members and reflects negatively on the public image of students. AberSU is also painfully aware that unforeseen circumstances resulting from such activities can cause anguish that may affect students and their families both personally and academically. It is also a requirement of the British Universities Colleges Sport (BUCS) that all Universities must have an initiation policy in order to compete in the BUCS competitions.}


\section{Definitions}
\subsection{An `Induction' is defined as:}
An event where new members are introduced to the rules, hierarchy and other members of the club/society they have joined. \newline 
Inductions often take the form of a social event, based on the university campus.\newline
\begin{center}
\textbf{Inductions are allowed at AberSU.}
\end{center}

\subsection{An `Initiation Ceremony' is defined as:}
An event in which members, (often new members) of a club are expected to perform a task or tasks, as a means to gaining credibility, status or entry within that club. This may be achieved by peer pressure (although not explicitly) and may compromise a person’s inherent dignity by forcing or requiring an individual to drink alcohol, eat mixtures of various foodstuffs, nudity and any other behaviour that may be deemed humiliating. This also extends to online initiation activities on social networking sites or blogs, etc. Individuals should not be pressured into divulging personal information, be subject to comments, photos or images that demean or compromise the dignity of individuals or groups.\newline
\textbf{‘Initiation Ceremonies’ are not allowed at Aberystwyth University Students Union.}
\begin{center}
\textbf{Social events which involve any or all of the above elements are also not allowed at AberSU on or off site.}
\end{center}

\newpage
\section{Code of Conduct}
All students involved in club and society social events or induction evening for new and returning members MUST follow this code of conduct. Failure to do so will lead to disciplinary action.
\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
  \item As a representative of the club/society you have a ‘duty of care’ to all your club/society members.
  \item Under NO circumstances can the membership of a University club /society be awarded upon the completion of task(s) as defined in the explanation of initiation ceremonies above.
  \item All activity groups’ members must recognise and adhere to the AberSU equal opportunities. It is an individual's choice whether or not they attend any social event.
Non-attendance should not be a barrier within the activity.
  \item Students should not feel coerced, pressured or forced into taking part in any games, ceremonies or activities (including online activities), unless they so choose. Peer pressure is not acceptable.
  \item All students should be made aware at the beginning of all social/induction evenings that at no time is the consumption of drink (alcoholic or not) or foodstuffs mandatory.
  \item All members of sports clubs or societies must show respect towards members of the public and other members of the University College at all times.
  \item Under NO circumstance should a club/society undertake an ‘initiation ceremony’. Any member of a club/society found to be arranging or involved in an ‘initiation ceremony’ will face disciplinary action which may result in the student being excluded from university.
\end{enumerate}

Any breach of this policy will result in one or more of the following:\newline
Club/Society receives a fine (up to £500)/ account frozen

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
  \item Activities Office grant withdrawn
  \item Member(s), team(s) or club removed from specific match, matches or removed from all competitions
  \item Withdrawal of facilities for training and/or competition
  \item Suspension or complete closure of the club
  \item Member(s) referred to Student Union disciplinary procedure
  \item Referral to the police.
\end{itemize}

If any incidents occur at the end the academic year, the sanctions may be levied for the following year. As an AberSU member you must understand that you have a responsibility to report to the AberSU any activities which break this code.
